# Working Envelope Diagram (Placeholder for CAD)

## Overview
- Visualizes the 3D operational space of the robot’s arm and navigation area in a food warehouse.

## Components
- **Arm Reach**:
  - Horizontal: 0.6–1.0m (covers aisle shelves)
  - Vertical: 0–2.0m (accesses high shelves)
  - Shape: Cylindrical envelope around arm base, 6-DOF flexibility
- **Navigation Area**:
  - Floor: 50m x 30m, 0.8m min aisle width
  - Height: 2.5m max (avoids ceiling fixtures)
- **Safety Zone**:
  - 0.5m buffer around robot for obstacle avoidance
  - 0.2m emergency stop zone
- **Docking Area**:
  - 50cm radius around charging station, IR-guided

## Notes
- Create diagram in Fusion 360 or Blender showing arm reach (cylinder/sphere) and navigation area (floor plan).
- Highlight food safety zones (e.g., cold storage areas).
- Save final diagram as `design/working_envelope_diagram.png`.
