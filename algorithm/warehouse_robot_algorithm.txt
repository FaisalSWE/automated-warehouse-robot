1. Start system and run diagnostics (battery, sensors, arm calibration).
2. Scan warehouse layout using LIDAR and Cartographer SLAM, save map as .pgm.
3. Read item tags (QR codes) using OpenCV to localize objects.
4. Ensure gripper hygiene with UV sterilization if needed.
5. Monitor temperature for cold storage compliance (0–5°C).
6. Receive task (item ID, shelf location) from WMS via REST API.
7. Plan optimal path to target shelf using A* algorithm in ROS.
8. Avoid real-time obstacles using LIDAR and ultrasonic sensor feedback.
9. Pick item with 6-DOF arm and soft gripper, verify with weight sensor.
10. Navigate to drop-off zone following planned path.
11. Place item accurately, verify with camera.
12. Update inventory via MQTT to WMS.
13. Repeat or return to charging station if no tasks or low battery.
