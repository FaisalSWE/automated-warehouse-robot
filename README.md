# ðŸ¤– Automated Food Warehouse Robot

This project proposes the design and control logic for a **fully autonomous robot** that transforms a traditional food warehouse into a **smart, human-free logistics system**.

---

## Project Goals

- Pick and place food packages without human intervention.
- Navigate safely around the warehouse.
- Communicate with a central inventory system.
- Automatically return to charge when idle.

---

## Execution Algorithm

1. Start system and run diagnostics.
2. Scan the warehouse layout using LIDAR/depth cameras.
3. Read item tags (QR/RFID) to localize objects.
4. Receive task from central server or local queue.
5. Plan optimal path to target shelf using A*.
6. Avoid real-time obstacles using sensor feedback.
7. Use robotic arm to pick item.
8. Navigate to drop-off zone.
9. Place item accurately.
10. Update inventory over Wi-Fi.
11. Repeat or return to charging station.
